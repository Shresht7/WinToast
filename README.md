# ðŸªŸ WinToast

A simple, lightweight command-line interface for creating and displaying native Windows Toast Notifications.

## Usage

The basic usage is to provide a title and a message as positional arguments.

```powershell
WinToast "My Notification Title" "This is the message body."
```

You can also use flags to specify the title and message, along with other options to customize the notification.

```powershell
WinToast --title "My Title" --message "My message" --image "C:\path\to\image.png" --activate "https://github.com"
```

### Options

All arguments, except `title` and `message`, are optional. If at least a title or message is not provided, the help text will be displayed.
